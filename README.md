# 🕷️ ipcrawler
> *"The only person you are destined to become is the person you decide to be."* - Ralph Waldo Emerson

A simplified, streamlined version of **AutoRecon** while keeping core functionality of autorecon - the multi-threaded network reconnaissance tool that performs automated enumeration of services for CTFs, OSCP, and penetration testing environments.

## 🙏 Credits

**ipcrawler** is a fork of [**AutoRecon**](https://github.com/Tib3rius/AutoRecon) by [**Tib3rius**](https://github.com/Tib3rius). All core functionality, plugins, and the brilliant multi-threaded architecture are thanks to his incredible work. This fork simply provides a cleaner setup experience while maintaining all the powerful features of the original tool.

### 📖 Step-by-Step Setup Instructions

#### 🪟 **For Windows Users (Docker Recommended)**

**Step 1: Install Docker Desktop**
1. Download [Docker Desktop for Windows](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
2. Install and start Docker Desktop
3. Verify Docker is running: open PowerShell/CMD and run `docker --version`

**Step 2: Get ipcrawler**
```cmd
git clone https://github.com/neur0map/ipcrawler.git
cd ipcrawler
```

**Step 3: Run ipcrawler**
```cmd
# Double-click this file OR run from command line:
ipcrawler-windows.bat
```

**What the `.bat` file does:**
- ✅ Checks if Docker is installed and running
- 🔨 Builds the ipcrawler Docker image automatically (first time only)
- 🚀 Opens an interactive terminal with all security tools pre-installed
- 💾 Maps your `results/` folder so scan results persist after closing

**Inside the Docker container, you can run:**
```bash
ipcrawler --help           # Show beautiful help with examples
ipcrawler 127.0.0.1        # Test scan localhost
ipcrawler 10.10.10.1       # Scan your target
exit                       # Close container
```

#### 🐧 **For Linux/macOS Users (Local or Docker)**

**Option 1: Local Installation (Recommended for Linux)**
```bash
# One-liner setup
git clone https://github.com/neur0map/ipcrawler.git && cd ipcrawler && make setup

# If 'make' is not installed, run bootstrap first:
./bootstrap.sh && make setup
```

**What `bootstrap.sh` does:**
- 🔍 Detects your operating system (Ubuntu, Kali, macOS, Arch, etc.)
- 📦 Installs `make` automatically using your system's package manager
- 🎯 Provides specific instructions for your OS if automatic installation fails

**What `make setup` does:**
- 🐍 Creates a Python virtual environment in `./venv/`
- 📦 Installs all Python dependencies (Rich, colorama, etc.)
- 🔧 Downloads and installs security tools (nmap, nikto, dirb, etc.)
- 🔗 Creates global `ipcrawler` command that you can run from anywhere
- ✅ Verifies everything is working

**Option 2: Docker Setup (Works on all platforms)**
```bash
# Prerequisites: Install Docker first for your system:
# Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt install docker.io
# macOS: brew install --cask docker (or Docker Desktop)
# Then:

git clone https://github.com/neur0map/ipcrawler.git && cd ipcrawler
make setup-docker
```

**What `make setup-docker` does:**
- ✅ Checks if Docker is installed and running
- 🔨 Builds the ipcrawler Docker image with all tools
- 🚀 Opens an interactive Docker terminal
- 💾 Maps your `results/` folder for persistent storage

### 🔧 Understanding the Tools

#### `ipcrawler-cmd` (Local Installation Only)
- **Purpose**: Global command wrapper created during `make setup`
- **Location**: Installed to `/usr/local/bin/ipcrawler` (or similar system PATH)
- **What it does**: Activates the virtual environment and runs ipcrawler
- **Usage**: Allows you to run `ipcrawler target` from any directory
- **Do you need it?** Yes for local installation, not needed for Docker

#### Make Commands Reference

| Command | When to Use | What It Does |
|---------|------------|--------------|
| `./bootstrap.sh` | First time, if `make` is missing | Installs `make` for your OS |
| `make setup` | Local installation | Full local setup with tools |
| `make setup-docker` | Docker installation | Docker build + interactive session |
| `make docker-cmd` | Docker users | Start additional Docker sessions |
| `make clean` | When uninstalling | Removes everything (preserves results) |
| `make update` | Periodic updates | Updates tools and Docker image |

**Windows users:** Only use `ipcrawler-windows.bat` - no make commands needed!

## ⚙️ Configuration Files

ipcrawler uses TOML configuration files for customization. After running setup, config files are created:

### 📍 Configuration Locations

**Local Installation:**
- Main config: `~/.config/ipcrawler/config.toml`
- Global settings: `~/.config/ipcrawler/global.toml`

**Docker Installation:**
- Config files are inside the container at `/opt/ipcrawler/ipcrawler/`
- Changes persist only during the session

### 📝 `config.toml` - Main Configuration

Controls ipcrawler behavior and plugin settings:

```toml
# Basic ipcrawler options
# nmap-append = '-T3'          # Add flags to nmap commands
# verbose = 1                  # Default verbosity level
# max-scans = 30              # Maximum concurrent scans

# Global options
# [global]
# username-wordlist = '/usr/share/seclists/Usernames/cirt-default-usernames.txt'

# Plugin-specific options
# [dirbuster]
# threads = 50
# wordlist = [
#     '/usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt',
#     '/usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/big.txt'
# ]
```

**Common configurations:**
```toml
# For faster scans
nmap-append = '-T4'
max-scans = 20

# For OSCP exam (conservative)
nmap-append = '-T3'
max-scans = 10

# Verbose by default
verbose = 1
```

### 🌐 `global.toml` - Global Settings

Defines global options and pattern matching:

```toml
# Default wordlists
[global.username-wordlist]
default = '/usr/share/seclists/Usernames/top-usernames-shortlist.txt'

[global.password-wordlist]  
default = '/usr/share/seclists/Passwords/darkweb2017-top100.txt'

[global.domain]
help = 'Domain for DNS/AD enumeration'

# Pattern matching for interesting findings
[[pattern]]
description = 'CVE Identified: {match}'
pattern = '(CVE-\d{4}-\d{4,7})'

[[pattern]]
description = 'Potential vulnerability: {match}'
pattern = 'State: (?:(?:LIKELY\_?)?VULNERABLE)'
```
